# Vim is Magic!

I first encountered [http://www.vim.org](Vim) when I first started learning Linux (the author of the Linux command-line tutorial I was following at the time just happened to be a Vimmer), although I didn't really discover the power of Vim until fairly recently. I regularly use more than one computer, so as I started using Vim more seriously, I started using Git to sync my configuration changes across computers. This is the repo that handles that syncing (I have some [Bash scripts](https://github.com/DerHabicht/thus-utils) that execute when my computer starts that handles syncing).

Until recently, this was not a publicly available repository, as this config is probably not useful in its entirety to anybody that's not me. I decided to make it public, though, because I find that I learn a lot from seeing what other people have done with their configs. Maybe this will do the same for others.
